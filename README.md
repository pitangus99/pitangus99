Hi, I'm Peter for now I'm mainly concerned with a survey of farmland birds in Israel.
I've been interested in ecology for many years, but, besides a lot of reading and learning, I haven't had much time to do a thought-out ecology study. Now that I'm retired, I have the time.
The study basically tries to collect data on the bird species and their abundance and their association with various crops and crop types. the current study area is a highly heterogenous matrix of relatively small fields with seasonal and permanent crops, orchards, trees.
